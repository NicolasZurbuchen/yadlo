    // Konsist reads the *other* modules' Kotlin sources, and Gradle has no way to know that: the
    // scopes are built at runtime from strings (`scopeFromProduction("shared")`,
    // `scopeFromProject()`), so nothing in this module's declared inputs changes when a file in
    // `:shared` moves. Gradle therefore marks this task UP-TO-DATE and replays the previous
    // result.
    //
    // That is not a slow build, it is a false pass. Adding an `import ...app.App` to a file in
    // `core/` — a violation of two rules in `LayerBoundariesTest` — leaves `./gradlew
    // :konsistTest:test` green and UP-TO-DATE, while the same command with `--rerun-tasks` fails
    // on both. The flag has been the workaround; this makes it unnecessary, because a rule nobody
    // remembers to force is a rule that is not enforced.
    //
    // Declaring the real inputs would be the surgical fix and was rejected: `scopeFromProject()`
    // means "every .kt file in the repo", which is a fileTree over the root at configuration time
    // — awkward under the configuration cache, and silently wrong again the day a scope widens.
    // The task takes about fifteen seconds. Correctness is worth more than that here.
