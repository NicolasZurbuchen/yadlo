/**
 * **The rules for a `presentation/` that has no screens.**
 *
 * `PresentationLayerTest` is written for `feature/`, and nearly every rule in it describes a screen
 * — a Contract, a Store, a Route, the `*UiMapper` that converts one State into one UiModel. A
 * `core/` slice has none of those. It renders vocabulary that several features draw, and that is
 * all it does.
 *
 * Holding it to the feature shape is what produced the dead end in #74: the dietary mapper had no
 * legal home, because the one package allowed to import the domain from inside `presentation/` is
 * `screen/<name>/mapper/`, and a slice with no screens cannot have one. Widening the feature rule
 * would have made every feature's exception list longer to describe something that is not a
 * feature. This file describes what a `core/` presentation actually is instead.
 *
 * The rules that are genuinely shared — every `component/` rule, the ban on importing `data/`, the
 * `UiModel` suffix — stay in `PresentationLayerTest` and still apply here. Only the screen-shaped
 * ones are replaced.
