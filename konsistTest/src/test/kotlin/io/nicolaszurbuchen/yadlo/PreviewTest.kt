/**
 * A `*ScreenPreview` file is the only place a screen is ever seen without a device, so it is worth
 * having a shape rather than a habit. `HomeScreenPreview` is the reference; everything here is a
 * property of that file turned into a rule.
 *
 * **Two top-level declarations, and no more.** A provider class holding every fixture, and one
 * preview function. The pull is always to add a third — a helper that builds a UiModel, then a
 * second helper beside it, then a `private val` of sample data — and each one is individually
 * reasonable while the file stops being readable as "here are the states, here is the screen". The
 * fixtures belong *inside* the provider, where they are visibly in service of the sequence they
 * feed.
 *
 * **One preview function, not one per theme.** Light and dark are two renderings of one preview,
 * which is what a multipreview annotation is for: [PreviewThemes] carries both, so the body is
 * written once and a third rendering later is a change to the annotation rather than to
 * twenty-three files.

     *
     * `YadloPreview` is the opposite: it imports `YadloTheme` and `appColors`, so it *is* the design
     * system and could not live in `infra/` without inverting the layering.
     *
     * It is deliberately **not** in `app/design/component/`. Two reasons, and the first is
     * mechanical: `PresentationLayerTest` forbids a screen file suffix in a component package, and
     * `YadloPreview.kt` ends in one. The second is why that rule is right here — a component is
     * something a screen draws, and this is never drawn in a shipped screen. Filing it beside
     * `YadloHero` would offer it to anyone browsing for parts to build a screen from.
